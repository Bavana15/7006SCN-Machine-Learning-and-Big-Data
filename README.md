# 7006SCN-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data
Big Data Network Intrusion Detection (CICD DoS)
This project implements a scalable Big Data pipeline using PySpark (MLlib) to analyse and classify network traffic from the CICD DoS dataset. The workflow includes data ingestion, cleaning, schema alignment, feature engineering, and distributed model training. Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and One-vs-Rest classifiers) are trained and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall metrics.

Processed outputs and model evaluation results are exported as CSV files for interactive Tableau visualisation dashboards. The project demonstrates end-to-end Big Data processing, model comparison, and cybersecurity traffic behaviour analysis.

All experiments were executed in Google Colab with Google Drive integration for scalable storage and reproducibility.
